\section{Data and Methods}

The survey was constructed as a Google questionnaire with seven questions and one comment box. Four of the questions were about software use and most were inspired by the UK survey:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you use software in your research?
\item Have you had formal training in software development?
\item Which of these is more common in your work? (on writing one's own software)
\item Select any of these that you use regularly to write code for your research. (on most commonly used software tools)
\end{enumerate}
The remaining three questions requested basic demographic information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is your field of research?
\item What is your career stage?
\item What is the location of your institution?
\end{enumerate}

The survey was open on December 9th, 2014. The attendees of the .Astronomy conference were asked to forward it to their home departments. A link to the survey page was also posted on the astronomy Facebook page. The survey received 758 responses in the first day (12/9) and another 210 during the second day (12/10). The data for this work was collected on February 3rd 2015. The number of participants at that time was 1145. Three responses from participants who indicated that they work in fields other than astronomy were removed for a final tally of 1142 participants.
