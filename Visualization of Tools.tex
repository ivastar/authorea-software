\subsection{Interactive Visualization Of Software Tools}
\label{ssec:d3viz}

To facilitate understanding of this multi-dimensional dataset of how use of the various software tools overlap with each other, we provide an interactive visualization, available by downloading the software repository described in Section \ref{sec:intro}, or at \href{http://eteq.github.io/software_survey_analysis/software_tools_heirarchy_d3vis.html}{this link}. In this visualization, the tools respondents use are shown as sectors in a radial layout.  Users of multiple tools are represented as stacked sectors: for example, the fraction of users who use only Python and IDL are represented as the fraction of the third ring labeled ``idl'' with ``python'' and ``idl'' as the lower two layers.  Hovering over that sector shows the number of respondents to the left of the page (for Python and IDL only it is 36.)  Clicking on a particular sector expands the visualization to show only those who use the corresponding stack of tools, while clicking on the central circle goes back to larger segments of the survey.
