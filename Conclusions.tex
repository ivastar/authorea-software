\section{Conclusions}

Tetative conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item Most astronomers write their own software but are not trained to do it.
\item Python is the dominant language now, true roughly independent of age
\item Anything interesting about the Venn diagram, esp. IDL vs. Python
\item Theorists have a "narrow stack", also Grads but less so.  But the order pretty much stays the same.
\item therefore, just teach them those things and it should be good
\item Not much variation internationally, but (IDL and IRAF?) significantly more in the US vs. not, and Germans like C and David Hasslehoff
\end{itemize}
