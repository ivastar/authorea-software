\subsection{Visualization Of Software Tools Overlap}
\label{ssec:d3viz}

To facilitate undertanding of the highly multi-dimensional dataset of how use of the various software tools overlap with each other, we provide an interactive visualization, available by downloading the software repository described in Section \ref{sec:intro}, or directly at the web site \url{http://eteq.github.io/software_survey_analysis/software_tools_heirarchy_d3vis.html}. In this visualization, the tools respondents use are shown as sectors in a radial layout.  Users of multiple tools are represented as stacked sectors: for example, the fraction of users who use only Python and IDL are represented as the fraction of the third ring with "Python" and "IDL" as the lower two layers.  Clicking on a particular sector expands the visualization to show only those who use the corresponding stack of tools.
