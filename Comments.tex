\section{Comments}

We allowed participants to leave comments at the end of the survey to further get a sense of the attitude to this topics. We thank so many of the participants for leaving thoughtful comments. We find that there are two recurring topics in the comments. The first such topic is the switch from IDL to Python. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{I recently switched from using IDL as my primary programming language to using python. (Graduate student)}
\item{Mainly IDL user who wants to switch to python as it is more open source. (Graduate student)}
\item{I learned IDL as an undergrad and continue to mostly code in it as a grad student. However I've been learning Python lately and plan to mostly switch over within the next year or so. (Graduate student)}
\item{I plan to learn Python but haven't yet worked with it. (Graduate student)}
\item{At this stage I see Python as the future and am rapidly moving away from IDL. (Graduate studen)}
\item{I learned IDL as an undergrad (class of 2004) and used it nearly exclusively [...] until about two years ago. Over the last two years I've been slowly switching to Python [...]
(Postdoc)}
\item{I've only recently started working in IDL and Python.  I expect to do quite a bit of development in Python from now on. (Postdoc)}
\item{I've only recently started working in IDL and Python.  I expect to do quite a bit of development in Python from now on. (Postdoc)}
\item{I want to learn python and R as soon as posible (Postdoc)}
\item{While I haven't learned it yet many of my colleagues use python and I make all of my students learn that (instead of e.g. matlab). (Faculty)}
\item{I am telling all of my students to learn Python and through that I am also gaining proficiency in python.  This is different from what my advisor did.  He told me to use the language that he used so that he could help me debug it. (Faculty)}

\item{Moving to Python as IDL needs a licence... And I just like the language. (Faculty)}
\item{Currently I code in IDL but I am trying to switch to python. (Faculty)}
\item{I plan to switch from IDL to python over the next 2-3 years. (Faculty)}
\item{I'm intending to try out Python soon. (Faculty)}
\item{I find python in particular to be incredibly useful and have taken to using its object-oriented features much more over the years.  During the stage of my career when I might have learned IDL it was too expensive for me and we didn't have a site license.  I might use it if that had not been the case. (Faculty)}
\item{Taking a workshop on Python soon I can encourage and help my students learn a language that can be used outside of academia as well. (Faculty)}
\end{itemize}
