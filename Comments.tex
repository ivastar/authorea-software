Comparison with the SSI survey:

90\% of astronomers write some of software. This is much larger than the SSI survey which finds that 56\% of researchers write some of their software, i.e., astronomy depends much more on software than other sciences.

In the SSI survey, 55\% of respondents say they have received some training in software development, with 40\% indicating that the training was a formal course and 15\% indicating self-directed study. Our categories are not identical, but we find that a similar fraction of astronomers - 57\% say that they have received some form of training. However, only 8\% say that the training was substantial, while 49\% say they received a little training. The decision what constitutes a lot and a little was left to the participants, but those who chose to expand on their decision indicated that a lot corresponded to a formal class while a little corresponded to using on-line materials such as Software Carpentry and Code Academy.
