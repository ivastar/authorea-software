\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

In this section we show the results from the survey. We first focus on software use and whether astronomers write their own software. We then examine the training we receive in software development. We discuss the most commonly used tools. In all cases we show the results as a function of career stage, research area and geographic location. We use Poisson errors throughout. 

\subsection{Software Use}

The first question of the survey aims to establish a baseline of software use. The answers to the question "Do you use software in your research?" are shown in Figure \ref{fig:doyouse}. Unanimously, all participants responded with "Yes". The question was not meant to be rhetorical, however this unanimity is somewhat expected. It would be difficult to imagine pursuing astronomical research today which does not rely on software at least to some extent. The unanimity again underscores the importance of software in the field.
