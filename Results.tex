\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

In this section we illustrate the results from the survey. We provide interpretation of these results in the conclusions (Section \ref{sec:conc}).

\subsection{Software Use}

The first question of the survey aims to establish a baseline of software use. The answers to the question "Do you use software in your research?" are shown in Figure \ref{fig:doyouse}. Unanimously, all participants responded with "Yes". The question was not meant to be rhetorical, however this unanimity is somewhat expected. It would be difficult to imagine pursuing astronomical research in any area today which does not rely, at least to some extent, on software. The unanimity also underscores again the importance of software use in the field and motivates by itself this survey.
