\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

In this section we show and describe the results from the survey. We first focus on software use and whether astronomers write their own software. We then examine the training we receive in software development. Finally, we discuss the most commonly used software tools. In all cases we consider how career stage, research area and geographic location alter these results. Where relevant, we assume Poisson statistics for error bars and to provide estimates of significance.

\subsection{Software Use}

The first question of the survey aims to establish a baseline of software use. The answers to the question ``Do you use software in your research?" are shown in Figure \ref{fig:doyouse}. Unanimously, all participants responded with ``Yes". This unanimity is not surprising: It would be difficult to imagine pursuing astronomical research today which does not rely on software at least to some extent. But the unanimity does serve to underscore the importance of software in the field.
